<img src = "/img/posts/screen_site.png" style = "margin:30px" align=right>Excited to announce our new modern and responsive website with an improved interface and updated content. We added a news blog section to write posts of interest to academic researchers and keep authors and readers up to date with Tropical Plant Pathology.

Among the several improvements in this version, we prepared a simplified version of our instructions for authors a FAQ section with the most frequently questions received from the community.

There is a new section with detailed information and links to academic webpages or each of our 23 Section Editors from a total of 11 countries. We will soon activating a new page which will allow searching our archives of articles published from 1976 to 2000 year. During the last two years individual PDFs for the articles were prepared and cataloged using Mendeley. An interface will be available to filter by year and search author and title fields. 

Hope you enjoy our website!
