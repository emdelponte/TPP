The latest assessment of scholarly serial publications was made available in early June with the release of the 2017 CiteScore metrics, based on Scopus citation database. A quick analysis of 11 selected similar journals that cover the broad subject of plant pathology shows TPP among three journals with the most increased score (four positions) during the last five years. The current score is 1.07, which is 50% higher than six years earlier.

This rapid growth may be due to some changes in the period including publication of papers only in English language (2012), which allowed to increase the number of international Editors. In 2015, TPP has been published by Springer Nature. We are thankful to all Editors and anonymous reviewers who dedicate time and contribute to the quality of the articles.
