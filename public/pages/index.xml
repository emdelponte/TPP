      <description>Last update: 20 November 2018 1. Scope
Submissions must report original research that provides new insights into the etiology and epidemiology of plant disease as well as population biology of plant pathogens, host-pathogen interactions, physiological and molecular plant pathology, and strategies to promote crop protection.

2. Manuscript submission
 Submission of a manuscript implies that: 
the work described has not been published before; it is not under consideration for publication anywhere else; its publication has been approved by all co-authors, if any, as well as by the responsible authorities – tacitly or explicitly – at the institute where the work has been carried out.</description>
