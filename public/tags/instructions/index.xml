      <description>Starting in December 2018, TPP will no longer accept for publication first reports of diseases/pathogen in a geographic location. Special cases had been published as short communication, including new diseases in a country, disease of major economic significance for major crops, etc. We will continue to publish original research that is not limited to report the new occurrence of a known disease or pathogen but go beyond including description of new taxa and pathogen population and epidemiological aspects using data from more extensive surveys.</description>
